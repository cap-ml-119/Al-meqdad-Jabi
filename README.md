In this code we will work with apis and apply all of the crud operations on a todo list.

Crud operations:
1-Create.
2-Read(Get).
3-Update.
4-Delete.

we will have 6 apis each will work on a differant crud operation.

1-Create Api.
2-Update the data by ID.
3-Update the status by ID.
4-Delete by ID.
5-Get all data.
6-Get data by ID.

each row of data will have a unique id generated by pthon uuid library.
